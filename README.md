[2. Selection Sort](#selection-sort)

### Quick Sort
Quicksort is a sorting algorithm, which is leveraging the divide-and-conquer principle.
The input list is divided into two sub-lists by an element called pivot; one sub-list with elements less than the pivot and another one with elements greater than the pivot. This process repeats for each sub-list.
### Selection Sort
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.
